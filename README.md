# Data Store for Decenwser

</div>

This program written to run on the Solana blockchain has the purpose of saving the respective HTML and JS data of each web page. The program is deactivated to date since this data architecture was no longer used in version 0.1.1. This program is the predecessor of the current program that runs behind Decenwser. However, the logic can be used by other projects focused on data distribution. Specifically, in everything related to p2p data exchanges.
